    //To any specific View - i.e. you can apply it to the
    //picture, but bot to the controls, etc.
    //Main thing - it works on the separate basis, not
    //the whle screen automatically, so yu can select areas where
    //recognition works, and the areas outside that view won't trigger the recognizer
